{"InitOpsLibrary": {"parameters": ["name", " trigger_lazy=True"], "comments": "    \"\"\"Loads a dynamic library that contains custom operators into Caffe2.     Since Caffe2 uses static variable registration, you can optionally load a     separate .so file that contains custom operators and registers that into     the caffe2 core binary. In C++, this is usually done by either declaring     dependency during compilation time, or via dynload. This allows us to do     registration similarly on the Python side.     Args:         name: a name that ends in .so, such as \"my_custom_op.so\". Otherwise,             the command will simply be ignored.     Returns:         None "}, "GetImportedOpsLibraries": {"parameters": [""], "comments": ""}, "_init_impl": {"parameters": ["path", " trigger_lazy=True"], "comments": ""}}
